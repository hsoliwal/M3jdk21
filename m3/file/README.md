# M3File: narrow NIO file-edge receiver

`com.m3.file.M3File` is a minimal target-owned, Java21/module-info-enabled
read-only access boundary adapted from the canonical Synexia
`synexia-mindex/resource/.../MIndexResourceAccess.java`, Apache-2.0,
Git blob `1b4eb18b102f52be2d1e13589195b47e37f3b090`.

It does **not** create a filesystem implementation or retain a directory
object graph. It preserves the supplied `Path` instance/provider; stat calls
always refresh with NOFOLLOW_LINKS; `readAllBytes(maxBytes)` checks the
visible file type, reads through a caller-closed channel, and enforces both
the observed-size and streamed-length limits. Symlinks and directories do
not become regular files. Path, link and permission behavior remains NIO's.

The broader Synexia `MIndexResourceSnapshot`, `MIndexResourceWorkspace`,
Eclipse markers/deltas, tree scans, permissions and mutation APIs remain
unported. This is not full Eclipse workspace parity, an OS-level file
interning service, or permission to change existing `java.io.File` semantics.

Build `mvn -B -f m3/file/pom.xml test` or the containing Eclipse JMOD
builder in `m3/eclipse/optional-jmod/build.py`.

## Source and class content deltas

`fingerprint(long maxBytes)` admits one bounded raw-byte observation for either
source or binary files through this original file boundary. It retains a byte
count and four SHA-256 words, uses an 8192-byte scratch buffer, and keeps no file
payload. The streamed budget and the regular-file/link rules still apply. It
refuses detected size, modification-time or file-key changes, but does not claim
an atomic filesystem snapshot under concurrent writes.

`contentDelta(previous, current)` compares retained fingerprints without I/O or
parsing. `ADDED=1`, `REMOVED=2`, `CONTENT_CHANGED=4`; zero means matching
fingerprints or two known absences. Null is caller-established absence, never
an unread file or a failed observation. Existing admitted fingerprints should
be reused; calling `fingerprint` again deliberately reads again.

Raw byte fingerprints differ from the parser's UTF-16 and framed source-fact
identities. A matching digest does not certify collision-free equality, class
ABI, compiler bindings or complete task inputs. The existing build planner must
qualify those facts before skipping work. The [shared build contract](../docs/build-delta-invariant.md)
defines source, binary, dependency and configuration invalidation for Maven,
Gradle and the other fork consumers. The [mapping](../docs/name-mapping.d/m3file-build-delta-20261020.json)
keeps this extension with the original product module.

The `test` lifecycle now invokes `verify.py` against Maven's already compiled
module. It compiles the independent contract, checks the named module, builds
a linked image and reruns the same contract there. This includes real javac
compilations with unchanged dependency binaries and a constant-inlining witness.
Run `mvn -B -f m3/file/pom.xml verify` with Java 21 and Python 3.
Alternatively, `python3 m3/file/verify.py --java-home /path/to/jdk21 --output /path/to/proof`
also compiles the original module itself.

Canonical recipe: `com.synexia.m3jdk.CollectionsContractRefinement20261017`,
dataset `file-content-delta-20261020`, in Synexia's existing
`synexia-openrewrite-recipes/recipe-crates/m3-collections-contract-refinement-20261017`.
This is a new sealed dataset of the existing Java/text recipe composition.
Fork planner receivers and full M3JDK21 bootstrap qualification remain separate.
